          <p>Twelve years before the start of the series,
            the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much of the village and taking many lives.</p>
          <p>leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn,
            Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
          <p> Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger,
            viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. </p>
          <p> Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails,
            the children — taking their cues from their parents</p>
          <p>inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged,
            Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.</p>

          <p>"That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by them,
            and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage..." — Over 100 years ago,</p>
          <p>a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans,
            giant humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed to be to devour humans.</p>
          <p>There was an insurmountable gap in power between them and mankind, and as a result,
            humanity was rapidly exterminated to the brink of extinction.
            The survivors responded by constructing three concentric walls: Wall Maria</p>
          <p>Wall Rose and Wall Sina, which graced them with a century of peace. However,
            one day a Colossal Titan far larger than any other seen before breached the outer wall,
            allowing the smaller Titans to invade the human territory and forcing the survivors
            to retreat to the inner walls.</p>
          <p>Eren Jaeger, a boy whose mother was eaten during the invasion,
            vowed to wipe every last Titan off the face of the Earth, and joined the military determined to exact his revenge.</p>
